1) Container
	Advantages: 
	a) Stored in Contiguous memory addresses (more cache hits)
	b) 

2) List (Doubly Linked)
	Advantages:
	a) mylist.splice (itr, mylist2, itr_a, itr_b)
		Making a sub-list takes O(1) time; advantage	

	Disadvantages:
	a) Stored randomly; each element in memory (hence slower)
	b)

3) Forward List

For referring to custom hash function using unordered map, the most helpful resource that I found was:
http://www.drdobbs.com/windows/user-defined-hash-functions-for-unordere/231600210?pgno=3

Explanation on how to use functions and then pass the prototype to your unordered map declaration, how to avoid that completely by decalring it as a structure and doing operator overloading, and finally changing the hash function in the namespace std for the current project is shows in the pages 1-4 in the above link.
