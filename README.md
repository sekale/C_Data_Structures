# DataStructures-Algorithms
A repository containing different data structures for practice as well as open source contribution.
I plan to add MY solutions to problems that I find challenging. (Due Credit for the questions will be mentioned in each header)
Mostly will contain code in C/C++.

The repository STL_Library contains basic STL implementations.
I have used a lot of reference from Bo Qian's Youtube videos for this and some of the components may directly resonate.

These videos are very helpful, specially for someone like me starting to learn STL stuff.
